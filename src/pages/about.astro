            <p>
                I'm Cameron—a developer, a dad, and someone who believes the best solutions come from actually understanding the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't start in tech. I spent years as an HVAC technician, fixing broken systems and dealing with the frustration of inefficient processes. When I saw my coworkers spending hours on manual paperwork and dealing with constant errors, I didn't just complain—I taught myself to code and built something better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I build web applications that solve real problems for real people. I specialize in Python/Flask backends, React frontends, and the kind of DevOps work that keeps things running smoothly. But what I'm really good at is understanding what people actually need (not just what they say they need) and building tools that make their lives easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                My faith and my family shape everything I do. Being a father has taught me to think long-term, work with integrity, and build things that last. My relationship with God drives me to pursue excellence, serve others, and work with purpose—not just for a paycheck.
            </p>
            <p>
                I care about work that matters—whether that's helping small businesses run more efficiently, supporting churches and ministries with the tools they need, or building solutions for people doing honest, hands-on work. Clean code, good documentation, and sustainable solutions aren't just professional standards for me—they're reflections of doing things the right way.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, I'm spending time with my daughter (who keeps me grounded and reminds me what really matters), working on HVAC projects through my side business (AirElise), or learning something new. My faith teaches me to serve others and pursue excellence in everything I do—and that shows up in the work I deliver.
